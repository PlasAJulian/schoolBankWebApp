# schoolBankWebApp
Redid a Java bank web application class project. Built using NetBean. <br><br>
This is a bank web application I did back in school. In this assignment a user would be able to login and display their accounts and can deposit or withdraw from any of their accounts. <br>

Things I added. <br>
* Ability to add a new account
* Limit the amount of accounts one user can have.
* Edit their personal information.
* Create account if user does not have one.

Things I plan to add. <br>
* Allow money transfer
* Add admin to be the only one to be able add/create an account and create new user. Also be able to delete/close accounts.
